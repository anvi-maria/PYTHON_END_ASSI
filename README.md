Project Overview
This project involves analyzing a dataset from ABC company, consisting of 458 rows and 9 columns, to provide a comprehensive report detailing information about their employees across various teams. The analysis includes preprocessing the dataset, conducting specific analyses, presenting findings graphically, and offering insights based on the data.

Preprocessing Steps:-
Height Column Correction:
The "height" column was corrected by replacing its values with random numbers between 150 and 180 to ensure data consistency and integrity before proceeding with further analysis.

Analysis Tasks:-
Distribution of Employees Across Teams:Determine the number of employees in each team and Calculate the percentage of total employees for each team.

Segregation by Positions:Categorize employees based on their job positions within the company.

Predominant Age Group:Identify the most common age group among employees.

Highest Salary Expenditure:Determine which team and position have the highest total salary expenditure.

Correlation Between Age and Salary:Investigate the correlation between age and salary and represent this relationship visually.

Graphical Representations:-
For each analysis task, appropriate visualizations have been created to effectively present the findings:

Distribution of Employees Across Teams:

Bar chart showing the number of employees in each team.
Pie chart representing the percentage split of employees across teams.

Segregation by Positions:Bar chart displaying the number of employees in each position category.

Predominant Age Group:Histogram showing the distribution of employees' ages to highlight the predominant age group.

Highest Salary Expenditure:Bar chart illustrating the total salary expenditure for each team and position.
